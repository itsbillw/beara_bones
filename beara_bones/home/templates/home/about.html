    <p>
      <strong>What is itsbillw.eu?</strong><br />
      itsbillw.eu is my personal website, built and hosted on a Raspberry Pi
      running DietPi OS. It serves as a hub for my projects, experiments with
      FOSS (Free and Open Source Software), and a playground for learning and
      sharing ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>What’s the project about?</strong><br />
      This project brings together several interests: FOSS, Raspberry Pis (and
      other SBCs), and a desire to demystify data. The site is a Django app with
      a MariaDB database and Bootstrap on the frontend, behind NGINX. It runs on
      a Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB RAM) with an Aegon One M.2 SSD case (500GB) and
      DietPi OS. Alongside the website I run Nextcloud, Jellyfin, Plex, MinIO
      and other self‑hosted tools. Monitoring is with Netdata and status checks
      on Uptime Kuma. I gathered the equipment over the years and estimate a
      maximum spend of around €250. From readings on a Tapo smart plug, the
      whole home server uses under €10 of electricity per year (~€0.75/month).
