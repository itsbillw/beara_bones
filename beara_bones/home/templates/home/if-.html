    <h1 class="poem-title">If—</h1>
    <p class="poem-author">by Rudyard Kipling</p>

    <div class="poem-text">
      <p class="poem-stanza">
        If you can keep your head when all about you<br />
        Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br />
        If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br />
        But make allowance for their doubting too;
      </p>

      <p class="poem-stanza">
        If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br />
        Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br />
        Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br />
        And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
      </p>

      <p class="poem-stanza">
        If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br />
        If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;<br />
        If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br />
        And treat those two impostors just the same;
      </p>

      <p class="poem-stanza">
        If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br />
        Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br />
        Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br />
        And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:
      </p>

      <p class="poem-stanza">
        If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br />
        And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br />
        And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br />
        And never breathe a word about your loss;
      </p>

      <p class="poem-stanza">
        If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br />
        To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br />
        And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br />
        Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’
      </p>

      <p class="poem-stanza">
        If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br />
        Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br />
        If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br />
        If all men count with you, but none too much;
      </p>

      <p class="poem-stanza">
        If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br />
        With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,<br />
        Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br />
        And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
